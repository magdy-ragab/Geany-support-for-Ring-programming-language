# Geany-support-for-Ring-programming-language
this is geany highlight syntax support for Geany editor

Please follow these steps
1- download Geany editor if you didn't
2- click on "Tools -> configuration files -> filetypes_extensions.conf"  menu
3- add this line "Ring=*.ring;" without quotes after [Extensions]
4- in unbuntu copy file "filetypes.Ring.conf" to folder "/home/USERNAME/filetypes.Ring.conf"

* I believe this file can work under windows but It's not yet tested
* You can run your files by pressing F5 button
